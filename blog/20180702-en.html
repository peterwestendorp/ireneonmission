      <h1>Celebrate the tiny triumphs!</h1>
      
      <p>Recently, when I passed my 7th lesson of Portugese I went to a shop where I was able to ask for a
        plastic file folder and the cashier understood me! I am now at that point where I have heard and read
        a lot of verbs, only I need to be able to memorize them now. As well as the irregular ones…When I
        have class I try to speak more and more in Portugese, but I am glad my teacher still alternates from
        English to Portugese. At home sometimes I dare to ask one of the children a question in Portugese,
        but most of the time it doesn’t go without errors or misunderstandings.</p>
      
      <p>Someone showed me a nice running path, close to my house, which goes all the way (2,5 km) to a
        village called Sintra (beautifully green with a palace). Not that I make it all the way there, haha,
        because that will be more than 2,5km and I also need to get back. During running I found a Portugese
        Christian radio channel. They also played sometimes an English song and even an American style
        country song :-)</p>
      
      <p>The town where I live, I do not consider as beautiful, since it has a lot flat buildings and not a lot of
        green. What I do like about the town is that there are many cultures. This makes me feel as if I am
        already traveling in the direction of my next destination. There are many people here from Angola,
        also in the church I attend each Sunday. But also Brazilians and people from Cape-Verdie live here.
        The economy here is quite different from ours in the Netherlands, since the people earn salaries on
        an average between 600-900 euros. On the other hand food and rent is less expensive compared to
        the Netherlands.</p>

      <p>Did you know that a lot of elderly people (including couples), in Lisbon, spend a lot of their time in a
        shopping mall. Only because they have no airconditioning at home. It looks quite funny, as if that is
        their activity of the day. I am sure it might be sometimes more frustrating to them.</p>

      <p>Groetjes Irene</p>
