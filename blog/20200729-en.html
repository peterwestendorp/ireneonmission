      <h1>Blog Juli</h1>

      <p>You are probably curious how it is here in Angola. Many things have changed in the world since my
        last blog in April. Among other things, I am a year older :-) and was surprised by many nice messages
        from the Netherlands, thank you again for that! Friends and colleagues here also had made me a nice
        surprise, of which one was a beautiful cake and I have enjoyed this day a lot!</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, Angola, like many other countries, is in lock. There are only occasional flights and
          those arriving in Luanda are not allowed to travel to other provinces. There have been about 2
          months when I was more limited in work and living on the compound with several missionary
          families. In the meantime, life here in Lubango has returned to normal and I am also back in my own
          house. We take several preventative measures, such as wearing a mouth mask wherever we go in
          the city. Keep away from shops in the line, where the temperature is also measured and hand
          hygiene is applied. Unfortunately, this does not mean that Covid is not present, because there are
          about 700 positive cases known in and around the capital Luanda. Of which 30 people have died and
          about 200 have already completely recuperated.</p>

          <p>In terms of work, there are also a number of changes, including that I have distanced myself from the
            prevention work, because the team is doing very well! It was an enrichment to work with them in the
            past year and to get to know my immediate colleagues and the ins and outs of the work. I keep in
            touch with them, because these nurses also work with the after care program, for counseling and
            health classes. Now I have more time for work in after care and I am also looking for a good way to
            fill in other hours. At the moment I have already had several ideas and conversations, with people
            within the SIM organization, but also within the hospital. More about this later.
          </p>

          <p>Within the after care program we started giving culinary lessons a month ago. This with the aim to
            teach our patients group more variety in the meals, but also to make snacks that are often sold on
            the street. So that they can earn some money with that. This week we are happily &quot;surprised&quot; with a
            premature baby in the village near the hospital. This baby is the son of one of our former patients.
            We are very happy that she came in time for the caesarean section and that she is doing well so far,
            because the boy weighs only 1600 grams.</p>

          <p>Since a couple of months there is a patient whom has been very open about her belief in God. She
            really is a testimony and I pray that she may be an encouragement to many other women. She has
            had this condition (fistula) since 2001 and has no husband or children. She has already visited many
            cities in search of cure. More or less lived in a hospital in another city for about 5 years in the hope
            that a doctor would have a solution there. All this without a family member ... I checked several
            times if I had understood the story correctly ... because it did touch me. Since she arrived here, she
            has almost always shown a smile, joy, peace and an inspiring faith. She had come to faith when she
            was 16, but she found that she actually really got to know God from the time she fell ill. Incredible…
            but at the same time not surprising, because this is what God gives you, if you put your trust in Him in
            all circumstances.</p>

          <p>Although I have no certainty what life will look like here in the coming months, nor about a visit to
            the Netherlands, I still feel okay in this situation. Partly due to the fine network of local and
            international friends. Some very nice local friends recently said that they wanted to go to the
            Netherlands to tell my family that they will continue to take good care of me! How sweet!</p>

          <p>Sometimes I really laugh at the way people show me a direction. For example at the woman who
            sells oranges you go to the right, with this oak tree you go left again. My photographic memory has
            improved a lot because of this! There are also quite a few rules in traffic… as usual, but unfortunately
            not always clearly marked with traffic signs. Which again puts my memory to the test. I am grateful
            that I am still able to borrow a car, currently a hospital car, which is normally for (temporary mission)
            doctors, but who cannot come because of the lock down. This is a huge help! Because in addition to
            my work, in recent months we have also regularly brought a food package to families who were
            unable to perform their work due to the lock down. Unemployment is unfortunately always visible,
            but this situation made me even more aware of it. An example of this; Recently, a young woman of
            about 25 came to the gate of my house to ask if I don&#39;t know anyone who has a job for her. This was
            the first time for me that someone came to the gate to ask for a job, people and children come
            regularly for food or ask for a 50 cent. I responded that I don&#39;t know anyone and when I entered my
            house I felt guilty because I hadn&#39;t even asked what kind of work she was looking for…</p>

          <p>Another short story and then I finish: recently I went to a farm 4 hours away from here for a
            weekend (so in the middle of nowwhere). With four local friends, to celebrate, among other things, that
            the church was allowed to reopen there, after the lock down. It was a party, with social distancing
            and masks though ... it was nice to be here. The 4 friends have a ministry here since quite some time.</p>
      
      <p>Beijinhos!</p>
